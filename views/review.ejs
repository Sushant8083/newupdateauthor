                  Writing is an art that is not mastered by many. Hence it
                  becomes essential to learn the skills from the horse's mouth
                  himself. Mr. Dinesh Sahay has penned down many books so he

                  booklet that has been written keeping in mind the fact that
                  the readers can also create their own life story in the form
                  of a notebook. There comes a time in life when many people

                  The Author feels that our life is cause and effect
                  relationship. We can also say‚Äô What we sow, so shall we reap‚Äô.
                  He says that if the youth can assess their forthcoming life
                  and remove their weakness and make their strengths stronger
                  then, their futures could be brighter. For assessing the
                  future, he has given a questioner with multiple options to
                  select from. Based on which option the reader chooses, marks
                  are allotted to him/her. Results of all the questions is
                  cumulated and then based on that, reader can assess him
                  position. Also, Author has some steps or guidelines as to how
                  can one improve oneself. Based on these guidelines, I have
                  started ‚Äògoing to bed early and getting up early‚Äô,‚Äô Gratitude
                  to Almighty‚Äô, ‚ÄôAppreciating others‚Äô. One main value addition
                  that this book has done in my life is I have started using
                  more positive words and avoiding negative words even in self
                  talk. Also, here is an exercise at the end of the book which
                  helps us to forgive others and free ourselves from the
                  negative feelings we have for these people. I really found
                  this exercise helpful. I am really proud of such Indian
                  Authors. India is blessed with such good Authors like him.
                  Look forward to read more books authored by him. All in all,
                  this book will for sure make some or other value addition to
                  your life.

                  The book caught my attention right from the cover and the
                  title, as I expected, it is a self-help book that will surely
                  guide us to order, arrange and view our life to be more
                  productive and happier. It gives guidelines for the reader to
                  see life differently and that's what makes the life different.
                  Rather than complaining the burdens of lives, one must learn
                  to plan and execute the goals that would leads us to better
                  achievements. A good simple read that everyone should give a
                  try.
